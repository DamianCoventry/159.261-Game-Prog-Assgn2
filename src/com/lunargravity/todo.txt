Refactor a piece of the Widget system:
    Remove the background image from the widget class
    Replace it with view layers, where each layer has a diffuse texture and a blending parameter
    Make the view layer order explicit
    Make the order of the child widgets explicit
    Make an explicit hit box size in the widget instead of using the old diffuse texture as the size
    Use the centre of the hit box as the origin for drawing
    Each view layer must calculate its own center and put that center on the origin
